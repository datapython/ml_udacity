This repo contains the projects I did for Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree.  

## Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices (`boston_housing/`) 
### Overview 
Built a regression model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.   

**Keywords:** statistical analysis, metric performance, cross validation, bias/variance tradeoffs, learning curves, model complexity

## Project 2: Finding Donors for CharityML (`finding_donors/`) 
### Overview 
Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency. 

**Keywords:** classification, logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, model tuning

## Project 3: Creating Customer Segments (`customer_segments/`) 
### Overview 
Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis. 

**Keywords**: clustering, pca, feature selection, k means, gaussian mixture model

## Project 4: Classify Images using Neural Network (`image_classification/`) 
### Overview 
Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset was preprocessed (image normalization, label one-hot encoding), then trained a convolutional neural network with convolutional layer, max pool layer and fully connected layer on all the samples. The model was then evaluated on test samples. 

**Keywords:** classification, convolutional neural network, tensorflow

## Project 5: Classify Images using Neural Network (`smartcab/`) 
### Overview 
Applied reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. Identified the environment the driving agent operates in and the possible states the agent can be in. Implemented and optimized a Q-Learning algorithm to guide the agent towards its destination with consistently positive results. 

**Keywords:** reinforcement learning, q-learning, agent, environment, state
